# Personal Website Starter

This is a **no-framework**, single-file website starter "in the style of" minimalist academic pages (hero + publications + projects).  
It’s intentionally generic so you can customize it without copying anyone’s text, images, or CSS exactly.

## How to use

1. Edit `index.html`
   - Replace name, bio, email, and links.
   - Put your own image at `img/profile.svg` or replace the `src`.
   - Add your publications (grouped by year) and projects.
2. Optionally tweak `css/style.css` (colors are in the `:root` variables).
3. Push to your GitHub Pages repo (e.g., `<your-username>.github.io`).

### Git quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.github.io
cd <your-username>.github.io
# copy these files into the repo root, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Add starter site"
git push
```

That’s it. GitHub Pages serves from the `main` branch by default. If not, check the repo settings under **Pages**.
